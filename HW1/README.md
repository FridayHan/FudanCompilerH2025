# Homework Assignment 1

**See more on eLearning.**

**Do the following:**

1. **A simple “constant propagation”:** Write a visitor that is similar to MinusIntConvert, but for each binary operation on two constants, reduces the binary operation into a constant node (recursively from bottom up).*Your code must first use the minusIntConvert visitor to reduce the "- constant" to a constant.*
2. **"Execute the program":** Write another visitor that runs the program and prints the returned value (from the final return statement, you may assume there are no other return statements in the program). *(You need to remember the current values of the variables in a table. Use a member in the visitor to remember the table.)*
3. Use eLearning to **submit** your code package (follow the instruction). 

**You code will be tested with more test programs (fmj files) for grading.**
